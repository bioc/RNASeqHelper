Description:
    Perform a full DESeq2 analysis for your RNA-seq data, generating
    colourful Volcano and Kmeans-clustered Heatmaps, along with
    time-series gene plots for genes of interest. QC-metrics that such
    as PCA validation are built in, and the heatmaps generated show
    z-score scaled expression between contrasts for contrasted samples
    and all. Time series plots show gene trends on normalised,
    corrected, and scaled data, for varying cluster correlation
    thresholds.
